# OpenerOpener
libopener handler for iOS app Opener


### What it does:
Passes http:// and https:// links to the iOS app *Opener* (https://www.opener.link/) (https://github.com/timonus/OpenerManifest) via the *libopener tweak* (https://github.com/hbang/libopener), which in turn will open the link in its appropriate app or a favorite browser.


### The reason:
I made this because tweaks like BrowserChanger seem to overwrite Safari with your favorite browser. The problem with that is if you actually want to open something in Safari, you can't. This also adds the benefit of using a well maintain iOS app that has great link recognition to open link in appropriate apps.


### Requirements:
Opener from HASHBANG
Opener from iOS Appstore (https://apps.apple.com/app/id989565871)


### DEB:
Deb file in releases or you can find it on BigBoss repo in Cydia/Zebra/Etc.
